Bayesian,abn,Modelling Multivariate Data with Additive Bayesian Networks,GPL (>= 2),"Bayesian network analysis is a form of probabilistic  graphical models which derives from empirical data a directed acyclic graph, DAG, describing the dependency structure between  random variables. An additive Bayesian network model consists of a form of a DAG where each node comprises a generalized linear model, GLM. Additive Bayesian network models are equivalent to Bayesian multivariate regression using graphical modelling, they generalises the usual multivariable regression, GLM, to multiple dependent variables. 'abn' provides routines to help determine optimal Bayesian network models for a given data set, where these models are used to identify statistical dependencies in messy, complex data. The additive formulation of these models is equivalent to multivariate generalised linear modelling (including mixed models with iid random effects). The usual term to describe this model selection process is structure discovery. The core functionality is concerned with model selection - determining the most robust empirical model of data from interdependent variables. Laplace approximations are used to estimate goodness of fit metrics and model parameters, and wrappers are also included to the INLA package which can be obtained from <http://www.r-inla.org>. It is recommended the testing version, which can be downloaded by running: source(""http://www.math.ntnu.no/inla/givemeINLA-testing.R"").

Quantitative Analysis",Apache License 2.0,"We introduce a novel suite of informatics tools for the quantitative analysis of NMR metabolomic profile data. The core of the processing cascade is a novel peak alignment algorithm, called hierarchical Cluster-based Peak Alignment (CluPA). The algorithm aligns a target spectrum to the reference spectrum in a top-down fashion by building a hierarchical cluster tree from peak lists of reference and target spectra and then dividing the spectra into smaller segments based on the most distant clusters of the tree. To reduce the computational time to estimate the spectral misalignment, the method makes use of Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) cross-correlation. Since the method returns a high-quality alignment, we can propose a simple methodology to study the variability of the NMR spectra. For each aligned NMR data point the ratio of the between-group and within-group sum of squares (BW-ratio) is calculated to quantify the difference in variability between and within predefined groups of NMR spectra. This differential analysis is related to the calculation of the F-statistic or a one-way ANOVA, but without distributional assumptions. Statistical inference based on the BW-ratio is achieved by bootstrapping the null distribution from the experimental data. See Vu et al.

ExperimentalDesign,granova,Graphical Analysis of Variance,GPL (>= 2),"This small collection of functions provides what we call elemental graphics for display of anova

graphical displays that afford direct visualizations of data with respect to the fundamental
questions that drive the particular anova methods. The two main functions are granova.1w
(a graphic for one way anova) and granova.2w (a corresponding graphic for two way anova). These
functions were written to display data for any number of groups, regardless of their sizes
(however, very large data sets or numbers of groups can be problematic). For these two functions
a specialized approach is used to construct data-based contrast vectors for which anova data are
displayed. The result is that the graphics use straight lines, and when appropriate flat surfaces,
to facilitate clear interpretations while being faithful to the standard effect tests in anova.
The graphic results are complementary to standard summary tables for these two basic kinds of
analysis of variance; numerical summary results of analyses are also provided as side effects.
Two additional functions are granova.ds (for comparing two dependent samples), and granova.contr
(which provides graphic displays for a priori contrasts). All functions provide relevant
numerical results to supplement the graphic displays of anova data.
The graphics based on these functions should be especially helpful for learning how the methods have
been applied to answer the question(s) posed. This means they can be
particularly helpful for students and non-statistician analysts. But these methods should be
quite generally helpful for work-a-day applications of all kinds, as they can help to identify
outliers, clusters or patterns, as well as highlight the role of non-linear transformations of data. In the case

The design accounts for the issues that the efficacy of the treatment/vaccine groups may take time to accrue while the multiple treatment administrations/vaccinations are given; there is interest in assessing the durability of treatment efficacy over time; and group sequential monitoring of each treatment group for potential harm, non-efficacy/efficacy futility, and high efficacy is warranted. The design divides the trial into two stages of time periods, where each treatment is first evaluated for efficacy in the first stage of follow-up, and, if and only if it shows significant treatment efficacy in stage one, it is evaluated for longer-term durability of efficacy in stage two. The package produces plots and tables describing operating characteristics of a specified design including an unconditional power for intention-to-treat and per-protocol/as-treated analyses; trial duration; probabilities of the different possible trial monitoring outcomes (e.g., stopping early for non-efficacy); unconditional power for comparing treatment efficacies; and distributions of numbers of endpoint events occurring after the treatments/vaccinations are given, useful as input parameters for the design of studies of the association of biomarkers with a clinical outcome (surrogate endpoint problem).

An additive Bayesian network model consists of a form of a DAG where each node comprises a generalized linear model, GLM. Additive Bayesian network models are equivalent to Bayesian multivariate regression using graphical modelling, they generalises the usual multivariable regression, GLM, to multiple dependent variables. 'abn' provides routines to help determine optimal Bayesian network models for a given data set, where these models are used to identify statistical dependencies in messy, complex data. The additive formulation of these models is equivalent to multivariate generalised linear modelling (including mixed models with iid random effects). The usual term to describe this model selection process is structure discovery. The core functionality is concerned with model selection - determining the most robust empirical model of data from interdependent variables.

'gRbase' implements several graph algorithms (based mainly on

algorithms are:
(i) maximum cardinality search (for marked and unmarked graphs).
(ii) moralize.
(iii) triangulate.
(iv) junction tree.

'gRbase' implements functions for testing for conditional independence.
'gRbase' illustrates how hierarchical log-linear models may be
implemented and describes concept of graphical meta
data. These features, however, are not maintained anymore and
remains in 'gRbase' only because there exists a paper describing
these facilities: A Common Platform for Graphical Models in R:

screening rule preselecting the neighborhood of each variable
by correlation thresholding. We target on high-dimensional data
analysis usually d >> n, and the computation is
memory-optimized using the sparse matrix output. We also
provide a computationally efficient approach, correlation

representing the reasoning of human experts in a set of IF-THEN rules, to
handle real-life problems in, e.g., control, prediction and inference, data
mining, bioinformatics data processing, and robotics. FRBSs are also known
as fuzzy inference systems and fuzzy models. During the modeling of an
FRBS, there are two important steps that need to be conducted: structure
identification and parameter estimation. Nowadays, there exists a wide
variety of algorithms to generate fuzzy IF-THEN rules automatically from
numerical data, covering both steps. Approaches that have been used in the
past are, e.g., heuristic procedures, neuro-fuzzy techniques, clustering
methods, genetic algorithms, squares methods, etc. Furthermore, in this
version we provide a universal framework named 'frbsPMML', which is adopted
from the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML), for representing FRBS
models. PMML is an XML-based language to provide a standard for describing
models produced by data mining and machine learning algorithms. Therefore,
we are allowed to export and import an FRBS model to/from 'frbsPMML'.

procedures, thus offering a standard package for FRBS modeling to the R

The core of the package is ctree(), an implementation of
conditional inference trees which embed tree-structured
regression models into a well defined theory of conditional
inference procedures. This non-parametric class of regression
trees is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including
nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response
variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates.
Based on conditional inference trees, cforest() provides an
implementation of Breiman's random forests. The function mob()
implements an algorithm for recursive partitioning based on
parametric models (e.g. linear models, GLMs or survival
regression) employing parameter instability tests for split
selection. Extensible functionality for visualizing tree-structured
regression models is available. The methods are described in

compares the observed number of positive studies in a meta-analysis with
the expected number, if the summary measure of effect, averaged over the
individual studies, were assumed true. Excess in the observed number of
positive studies, compared to the expected, is taken as evidence of
publication bias. The observed number of positive studies, at a given level
for statistical significance, is calculated by applying Fisher's exact test
to the reported 2x2 table data of each constituent study, doubling the
Fisher one-sided P-value to make a two-sided test. The corresponding
expected number of positive studies was obtained by summing the statistical
powers of each study. The statistical power depended on a given measure of
effect which, here, was the pooled odds ratio of the meta-analysis was
used. By simulating each constituent study, with the given odds ratio, and
the same number of treated and non-treated as in the real study, the power
of the study is estimated as the proportion of simulated studies that are
positive, again by a Fisher's exact test. The simulated number of events in
the treated and untreated groups was done with binomial sampling. In the
untreated group, the binomial proportion was the percentage of actual
events reported in the study and, in the treated group, the binomial
sampling proportion was the untreated percentage multiplied by the risk
ratio which was derived from the assumed common odds ratio. The statistical
significance for judging a positive study may be varied and large
differences between expected and observed number of positive studies around
the level of 0.05 significance constitutes evidence of publication bias.
The difference between the observed and expected is tested by chi-square. A
chi-square test P-value for the difference below 0.05 is suggestive of
publication bias, however, a less stringent level of 0.1 is often used in
studies of publication bias as the number of published studies is usually
small.",NA

One way to explicitly model publication bias is via selection models or weighted probability distributions. In this package we provide implementations of several parametric and nonparametric weight functions. The novelty in Rufibach (2011) is the proposal of a non-increasing variant of the nonparametric weight function of Dear & Begg (1992). The new approach potentially offers more insight in the selection process than other methods, but is more flexible than parametric approaches. To maximize the log-likelihood function proposed by Dear & Begg (1992) under a monotonicity constraint we use a differential evolution algorithm proposed by Ardia et al (2010a, b) and implemented in Mullen et al (2009). In addition, we offer a method to compute a confidence interval for the overall effect size theta, adjusted for selection bias as well as a function that computes the simulation-based p-value to assess the null hypothesis of no selection as described in Rufibach (2011, Section 6).",http://www.kasparrufibach.ch

OfficialStatistics,gridsample,Tools for Grid-Based Survey Sampling Design,MIT + file LICENSE,"Multi-stage cluster surveys of households are commonly performed by
governments and programmes to monitor population-level demographic, social,

sampled in a second stage. In this typical two-stage design, sampled communities
are the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) and households are the Secondary Sampling
Units (SSUs). Census data typically serve as the sample frame from which PSUs
are selected. However, if census data are outdated inaccurate, or too
geographically course, gridded population data (such as <http://www.worldpop.org.uk>)
can be used as a sample frame instead. GridSample generates PSUs from gridded
population data according to user-specified complex survey design characteristics
and household sample size. In gridded population sampling, like census sampling,
PSUs are selected within each stratum using a serpentine sampling method, and can
be oversampled in urban or rural areas to ensure a minimum sample size in each of
these important sub-domains. Furthermore, because grid cells are uniform in size
and shape, gridded population sampling allows for samples to be representative of
both the population and of space, which is not possible with a census sample frame.",NA

It reproduces the model available in LAGRANGE (Ree and Smith 2008), as well as making available numerous additional models. For example, LAGRANGE as typically run has two free parameters, d (dispersal rate, i.e. the rate of range addition along a phylogenetic branch) and e (extinction rate, really the rate of local range loss along a phylogenetic branch). LAGRANGE also has a fixed cladogenic model which gives equal probability to a number of allowed range inheritance events, e.g.: (1) vicariance, (2) a new species starts in a subset of the ancestral range, (3) the ancestral range is copied to both species; in all cases, at least one species must have a starting range of size 1.  LAGRANGE assigns equal probability to each of these events, and zero probability to other events.  BioGeoBEARS adds an additional cladogenic event: founder-event speciation (the new species jumps to a range outside of the ancestral range), and also allows the relative weighting of the different sorts of events to be made into free parameters, allowing optimization and standard model choice procedures to pick the best model. The relative probability of different descendent range sizes is also parameterized and thus can also be specified or estimated.  The flexibility available in BioGeoBEARS also enables the natural incorporation of (1) imperfect detection of geographic ranges in the tips, and (2) inclusion of fossil geographic range data, when the fossils are tips on the phylogeny. Bayesian analysis has been implemented through use of the ""LaplacesDemon"" package, however this package is now maintained off of CRAN, so its usage is not formally included in BioGeoBEARS at the current time.

Note that the methods take into account the whole phylogeny, in particular it accounts for the ""pull of the present"" effect. (1-3) can take into account incomplete species sampling, as long as each species has the same probability of being sampled. For a given phylogeny on higher taxa (i.e. all but one species per taxa are missing), where the number of species is known within each higher taxa, speciation and extinction rates can be estimated under model (1) (implemented within LikShifts and bd.shifts.optim with groups !=0).

When conditioning on the number of final tips, the method allows for shifts in rates and mass extinction events during the birth-death process (sim.rateshift.taxa()). The function sim.bd.age() (and sim.rateshift.taxa() without extinction) allow the speciation rate to change in a density-dependent way.

Principle 1 determines all sensible univariate relationships in the spirit of the Markovian process. The relationship between each pair of variables, including predictors and the final outcome variable, is determined with the Markovian property that the value of the current predictor is sufficient in relating to the next level variable, i.e., the relationship is independent of the specific value of the preceding-level variables to the current predictor, given the current value. Principle 2 resembles the multiple regression principle in the way multiple predictors are considered simultaneously. Specifically, the relationship of the first-level predictors (such as Time and irradiance etc) to the outcome variable (such as, module degradation or yellowing)  is fit by a supervised additive model. Then each significant intermediate variable is taken as the new outcome variable and the other variables (except the final outcome variable) as the predictors in investigating the next-level multivariate relationship by a supervised additive model. This fitting process is continued until all sensible models are investigated.",NA

Johannesson (2008) <DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2007.00633.x>, decomposes the field,
and hence the covariance function, using a fixed set of n basis functions,
where n is typically much smaller than the number of data points (or polygons) m.
The method naturally allows for non-stationary, anisotropic covariance functions
and the use of observations with varying support (with known error variance). The
projected field is a key building block of the Spatial Random Effects (SRE) model,
on which this package is based. The package FRK provides helper functions to model,

Approach",GPL-2,"Functionality for spatio-temporal modeling of large data sets is provided. A Gaussian process in space and time is defined through a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). The SPDE is solved in the spectral space, and after discretizing in time and space, a linear Gaussian state space model is obtained. When doing inference, the main computational difficulty consists in evaluating the likelihood and in sampling from the full conditional of the spectral coefficients, or equivalently, the latent space-time process. In comparison to the traditional approach of using a spatio-temporal covariance function, the spectral SPDE approach is computationally advantageous. This package aims at providing tools for two different modeling approaches. First, the SPDE based spatio-temporal model can be used as a component in a customized hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM). The functions of the package then provide parameterizations of the process part of the model as well as computationally efficient algorithms needed for doing inference with the HBM. Alternatively, the adaptive MCMC algorithm implemented in the package can be used as an algorithm for doing inference without any additional modeling. The MCMC algorithm supports data that follow a Gaussian or a censored distribution with point mass at zero. Covariates can be included in the model through a regression term.",NA

TimeSeries,cointReg,Parameter Estimation and Inference in a Cointegrating Regression,GPL-3,"Cointegration methods are widely used in empirical macroeconomics
and empirical finance. It is well known that in a cointegrating
regression the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the
parameters is super-consistent, i.e. converges at rate equal to the
sample size T. When the regressors are endogenous, the limiting
distribution of the OLS estimator is contaminated by so-called second
order bias terms, see e.g. Phillips and Hansen (1990) <DOI:10.2307/2297545>.
The presence of these bias terms renders inference difficult. Consequently,
several modifications to OLS that lead to zero mean Gaussian mixture
limiting distributions have been proposed, which in turn make
standard asymptotic inference feasible. These methods include
the fully modified OLS (FM-OLS) approach of Phillips and Hansen
(1990) <DOI:10.2307/2297545>, the dynamic OLS (D-OLS) approach of Phillips
and Loretan (1991) <DOI:10.2307/2298004>, Saikkonen (1991)
<DOI:10.1017/S0266466600004217> and Stock and Watson (1993)
<DOI:10.2307/2951763> and the new estimation approach called integrated
modified OLS (IM-OLS) of Vogelsang and Wagner (2014)
<DOI:10.1016/j.jeconom.2013.10.015>. The latter is based on an augmented
partial sum (integration) transformation of the regression model. IM-OLS is
similar in spirit to the FM- and D-OLS approaches, with the key difference
that it does not require estimation of long run variance matrices and avoids
the need to choose tuning parameters (kernels, bandwidths, lags). However,
inference does require that a long run variance be scaled out.
This package provides functions for the parameter estimation and inference
with all three modified OLS approaches. That includes the automatic
bandwidth selection approaches of Andrews (1991) <DOI:10.2307/2938229> and
of Newey and West (1994) <DOI:10.2307/2297912> as well as the calculation of

Phenomena",GPL-2,"Statistical methods for the modeling and monitoring of time series
of counts, proportions and categorical data, as well as for the modeling
of continuous-time point processes of epidemic phenomena.
The monitoring methods focus on aberration detection in count data time
series from public health surveillance of communicable diseases, but
applications could just as well originate from environmetrics,
reliability engineering, econometrics, or social sciences. The package
implements many typical outbreak detection procedures such as the
(improved) Farrington algorithm, or the negative binomial GLR-CUSUM
method of Höhle and Paul (2008) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2008.02.015>.
A novel CUSUM approach combining logistic and multinomial logistic
modeling is also included. The package contains several real-world data
sets, the ability to simulate outbreak data, and to visualize the
results of the monitoring in a temporal, spatial or spatio-temporal
fashion. A recent overview of the available monitoring procedures is
given by Salmon et al. (2016) <doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i10>.
For the retrospective analysis of epidemic spread, the package provides
three endemic-epidemic modeling frameworks with tools for visualization,
likelihood inference, and simulation. 'hhh4' estimates models for
(multivariate) count time series following Paul and Held (2011)
<doi:10.1002/sim.4177> and Meyer and Held (2014) <doi:10.1214/14-AOAS743>.
'twinSIR' models the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) event
history of a fixed population, e.g, epidemics across farms or networks,
as a multivariate point process as proposed by Höhle (2009)
<doi:10.1002/bimj.200900050>. 'twinstim' estimates self-exciting point
process models for a spatio-temporal point pattern of infective events,
e.g., time-stamped geo-referenced surveillance data, as proposed by
Meyer et al. (2012) <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01684.x>.
